# R2RC - The ROS2 Race Car

Welcome! This is my ROS2 race car - R2RC for short. It's a fully autonomous race car built using ROS2 Humble on an existing (and highly modified) RC race car hardware platform. This project's goal is to autonomously race an unfamiliar track at the hardware's terminal speeds while avoiding suddenly placed objecs. And to have some extra fun outside of university classes :)
